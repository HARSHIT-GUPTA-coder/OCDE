You are given $n$ integers, $x_1, x_2, x_3 \cdots x_n$. <br>

You have to find an integer $a$ such that the $L_1$ deviation of the $n$ integers from $a$ is minimum.
That is you have to find $a$ such that the following expression is minimised:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{N} |x_i - a| $$ 

<h5> Input Format </h5>

The first line will contain the value of $n$. <br>
Then the second line will contain the $n$ integers separated by space <br>

<h5>Output Format </h5>

Output the value of $a$ in a single line. If multiple $a$ satisfy, print the smallest possible value. <br>

<h5>Constraints </h5>
$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$ <br>
$1 \leq x_i \leq 10^{18}$ <br>

It is guaranteed that a value of $a$ minimising this will fit in the long long variable. <br>
