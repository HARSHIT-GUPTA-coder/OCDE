Let $LCM(x,y)$ be the minimum positive integer that is divisible by both $x$ and $y$.
<br>
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$. Find two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $l \le x < y \le r$ and $l \le LCM(x, y) \le r$.
<br><br>
<h5>Input</h5>
The first line contains one integer $t$ $1 \le t \le 10000$ — the number of test cases.

Each test case is represented by one line containing two integers $l$ and $r$ $(1 \le l < r \le 10^9)$.
<br>

<h5>Output</h5>
For each test case, print two integers:<br>
1. if it is impossible to find integers $x$ and $y$ meeting the constraints in the statement, print two integers equal to $−1$ <br>
2. otherwise, print the values of $x$ and $y$ (if there are multiple valid answers, you may print any of them) <br><br>
